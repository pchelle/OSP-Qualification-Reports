# Qualification-DDI-P-gp
This repository contains a **qualification plan** (*qualification_plan.json*) including references to respective model snapshots and static content (e.g. text blocks, *.md files) to produce a **qualification report** evaluating the ability to perform simulations with the intended purpose to predict permeability glycoprotein (**P-gp**)-mediated drug-drug interactions (**DDI**) of the PBPK platform **PK-Sim** (as part of the open systems pharmacology (OSP) suite) .

The latest release of the qualification plan and the static content can be found [here](../../releases/latest).

**The latest release of the qualification report can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-Qualification-Reports/releases/latest).**

To demonstrate the level of confidence, the predictive performance of the platform for this indented purpose is assessed via a network of PBPK models of selected index P-gp DDI perpetrators, and the sensitive index P-gp victim drug digoxin and a comprehensive dataset from published clinical DDI studies. All PBPK models represent whole-body PBPK models, which allow dynamic DDI simulations in organs expressing P-gp.
